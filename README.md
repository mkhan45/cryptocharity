This site enables you to easily mine Turtlecoin in your browser. 
All Turtlecoin mined will go to the charity's wallet and then get donated. 
To start mining, set what % of your CPU power to use and then click start. 
Even if this site only makes 3 cents per person per hour, it adds up to $30 an hour if there's 1000 people.
